# Top 1000 Highest Grossing Movies Data Science Project

## In this project, movie dataset analyzed with the goal of performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning model building. 

* Top 1000 Highest Grossing Movies dataset in Kaggle is used for this project.
* A tool to estimate the World Sales in $ for a movie is created.


## Code and Resources Used
**Python Version:** 3.9

**Packages:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, ,,,,,,

## Data Insight
The dataset contains information about top 1000 highest grossing movies. It initially had 918 rows and 14 columns. Some of the important variables are:

* Titles 
* Genres
* Release dates
* Production companies
* Box office sales
* Movie runtime
* License

## Data Cleaning
* Unnamed column is dropped.
* Year information from movie title is omitted.
* Release date column is divided as year and month.
* A new column for the age of movie is created.
* Runtime is converted into minutes. 
* New columns called info_len and genre_num are created. 

These tasks ensure that the data is clean and ready for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Once the data is cleaned, exploratory data analysis is performed to gain insights into the dataset. This involves visualizing the data using various plots and charts to understand the relationships between variables, identify trends, and patterns.









Model Building
Finally, we will build a model to predict worldwide box office sales based on various features such as budget, genre, production company, and release date. We will evaluate the model's performance and make recommendations based on the results.

Conclusion
Overall, this project will provide a comprehensive analysis of the movie dataset, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model building. By the end of the project, we will have gained valuable insights into the movie industry and developed a model that can be used to predict worldwide box office sales.
