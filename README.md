# Top 1000 Highest Grossing Movies Data Science Project

## In this project, I will be analyzing a movie dataset with the goal of performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model building. 

The dataset contains information about various movies such as their titles, genres, release dates, production companies, budget, and worldwide box office sales. 

Data Cleaning
We will begin by performing data cleaning tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types. These tasks will ensure that the data is clean and ready for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Once the data has been cleaned, we will perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. This will involve visualizing the data using various plots and charts to understand the relationships between variables, identify trends, and patterns.

Model Building
Finally, we will build a model to predict worldwide box office sales based on various features such as budget, genre, production company, and release date. We will evaluate the model's performance and make recommendations based on the results.

Conclusion
Overall, this project will provide a comprehensive analysis of the movie dataset, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model building. By the end of the project, we will have gained valuable insights into the movie industry and developed a model that can be used to predict worldwide box office sales.
